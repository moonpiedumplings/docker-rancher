# Kata Containers

I found a guide to deploy Kata Containers on their [github](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/tools/packaging/kata-deploy/README.md), using the kata-deploy tool. 

According to a related doc [packaged install methods](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/install/README.md#packaged-installation-methods), kata-deploy is more for testing, and users are recommended to use the distro packages, as they have automatic updates. However, the only distro packages available are for Centos, and Fedora. 34. 

Some guides for ubuntu, like [this one](https://jafar390.medium.com/install-kata-containers-on-linux-with-docker-container-manager-28551ec8c034) ask to you add a [repository](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/katacontainers:/), but that repository is unmaintaned and has not been updated since 2019. 

There is also an unmaintained snap package. 


Another possibility is to use juju. Juju can add an externally managed kubernetes cluster, using the [add-k8s](https://juju.is/docs/juju/juju-add-k8s) command. (juju list-models will show where you can deploy to, and show-model gives more info.)

Then, you can use the juju operator to deploy the [kata charm](https://charmhub.io/kata)

Then, you should be able to upgrade the juju charm using [juju refresh](https://juju.is/docs/juju/manage-applications#heading--upgrade-a-charmhub-charm)


```{.default}
sudo snap install juju --classic
```

```{.default}
export PATH=/snap/bin:$PATH
```

```{.defualt}
juju add-k8s mycluster
```

But I get an error:

```{.default}
moonpie@ubuntu:~$ juju add-k8s mycluster
ERROR cannot load ssh client keys: mkdir /home/moonpie/.local: permission denied
moonpie@ubuntu:~$ sudo juju add-k8s mycluster
[sudo] password for moonpie: 
ERROR stat .: permission denied
moonpie@ubuntu:~$ 
```

I don't know why I get this error, but I am guessing it has something to do with snap sandboxing. 

Oh, I missed some [docs](https://juju.is/docs/juju/get-started-with-juju#heading--install-the-juju-cli-client).

```{.default}
mkdir -p ~/.local/share
```


```{.default}
kubectl config view --raw | juju add-k8s mycluster --client
```

```{.default}
juju add-model modelname
```

```{.default}
juju deploy kata
```

And it claims to have worked, but now my kubernetes command doesn't work:

```{.default}
moonpie@ubuntu:~$ kubectl get all
The connection to the server 127.0.0.1:6443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
```

Thankfully, the kubernetes shell located within rancher still works (I had been using kubectl from the single ubuntu vm I provisioned to be a controller and worker).

However, when I run the kata container test command, it doesn't work:

` Pods "php-apache-kata-qemu-799d4cd788-" is forbidden: pod rejected: RuntimeClass "kata-qemu" not found:Deployment does not have minimum availability.`

This makes me think that kata containers weren't actually installed. 

Well, I am first going to look into redownloading the kubeconfig file to the server, that way I can use both juju and kubectl on the same machine. 

I am also going to look into alternative options to use juju to configure a k3s/k8s server.
