Found on guide to create images using libvirt and cloud init:

<https://sumit-ghosh.com/posts/create-vm-using-libvirt-cloud-images-cloud-init/>

But a virt install ansible module doesn't seem to exist. 

This red hat guide looks pretty appealing, it discusses using an xml template for libvirt, and using cloud init to install the vm.

<https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/build-VM-fast-ansible>

Here are related ansible docs:

<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/libvirt/virt_module.html>

<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/libvirt/virt_net_module.html#ansible-collections-community-libvirt-virt-net-module>

I will need to create and start the default network.

Currently, I'm trying to get ansible in nix-shell working. I am having trouble installing the required dependencies.
